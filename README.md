# 2sound4u
My own version of xsound with better hhtp requests and less server side performance impacts.

## Installation
Drag and drop to you server
``ensure 2sound4u`` in server.cfg

## Performace
Runs with extremly low ms client side.
Medium performance server side when used, otherwise script is idle at 0.00 - 0.01 ms 

## Requirements
None, standalone.
(Better with qb-core)

## Commands

/streamermode - toggle all sounds on or off coming from the script.
